QRNet
=====
QRNet, sometimes also known as "The Clacks", is an ethernet tunnel providing an
opto-uncoupled ether via two laptops with webcams reading qr-codes from each
others display.

This tunnel was written at the Chaos Communication Camp (CCCamp). Until day 2
there was no stable internet connection at our part of the camp and wifi was
not reliable, but the guys across the road had a pretty decent connection.
Sadly no two beamers could be acquired and QRNet did not save the day.
Nevertheless the code has been finnished and a 90cm connection has been
established at camp site.


Installation and requirements
=============================
 * python-opencv
 * python-zbar
 * python-qrencode
 * python-gtk
 * ether2any
 * 2 displays
 * 2 webcams, videocams or other optical qrcode scanners

Configuration can be done in the conf.py. After starting the tunnel you need to
adjust the webcams. The percent bar at the bottom of the screen will show how
many qrcodes could be read per time interval.


How it works
============
The tunnel accesses the laptops webcam and tries to read a qrcode from each
received image. If it can be decoded, it is written as network traffic to the
interface as incoming traffic. Outgoing traffic is displayed as qrcodes on the
laptop's screen.


What could be done
==================
 * allow QRNet to run as an IP tunnel, configurable via config
